# Mortgage-Calculator-Website

A mortgage calculator website that allows the user to enter the principal, the interest rate, and their monthly payment into three input text fields
and calculate the total amount of interest that will be paid and how long it would take to pay off the entire mortgage. 

For each entry, a log of what was calculated will also be generated and saved. Users can also click one of the three inputs in a log entry to change the associated value of the text field to the one selected in the log entry. 

All log entries can be cleared at once or can be individually deleted by entering the same principal, interest rate, and monthly payment as the log entry that they want to clear into the three text fields and then selecting "clear an entry".
